 I am a first-year doctoral student in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) where I am advised by [Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/) and [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/).

 My research interests are primarily in machine learning and natural language processing. My goal is to build practical systems able to understand and reason about the world via natural language.

 Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Electrical Engineering at [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu) where I worked with [Doug Downey](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/) and [Thrasos Pappas](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~pappas/).  I've also spent time as a Software Engineer at Google.

 Outside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking, listening to a wide variety of music, trying new restaurants and [playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)) [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee).
