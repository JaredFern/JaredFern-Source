<br>
I am a senior at Northwestern University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, advised by Prof. Doug Downey and Prof. Thrasos Pappas. My current research focuses on methods for rapidly training statistical language models and developing objective metrics for measuring similarity in visual texture.

My research interests are primarily in machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing.
