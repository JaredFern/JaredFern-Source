## Applying to Grad School
If you're here, you are probably thinking about applying to graduate school and possibly have some ideas about why you enjoy research.

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **That's awesome! Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

So now what? It's time to apply -- and written statements make up a large component of the application process for both graduate programs and research fellowships.

- [Statement of Purpose](/files/sop_cmu.pdf)
- [NSF Research Statement](/files/GRFP_ResearchStatement.pdf)
- [NSF Personal Statement](/files/GRFP_PersonalStatement.pdf)

**You've done cool work! Now you get to talk about why it's awesome & where you go from here!**

Enunciating a longterm research direction can be quite difficult, while also being knee deep in experimental details of your current projects. While writing my own statements, I found it difficult to step back from my day-to-day work to create a more cohesive research plan.

Constructing a narrative about what your interests are and how they formed is much more convincing and interesting than a verbose version of your CV.

Here were a few questions that I found helpful while writing my own statements:

- What were the big picture problems I was trying to solve -- and how did I address them?
- What did I learn about the research process?
- How did affect my current view of the field? Did it cause my interests to change?
- How do these experiences prepare me to do good research & explore my interests in the future?

<!-- Lastly, there is a healthy dose of luck involved with admissions which makes the whole process a bit of a crapshoot. Rejection sucks but don't give up and try not to take things personally.

I was rejected from all of the schools I applied to the first cycle I applied but was eventually able find my way into an awesome PhD program.

But you know what? Don't forget, you're excited about research -- and that's still awesome! -->
<!-- * Opportunities: Independent Study, Thesis Projects, REUs
* Contacting Faculty: Courses, Office Hours, Academic Advisors/senior students, Emailing
* Learning the skillset, Familiarizing with the Literature -->

## Other Resources

Hopefully my ramblings were a bit useful, but if not, that's cool -- there are a ton of other super awesome resources floating around the internet.

In particular, these were pretty helpful for me:

* [Student Perspectives on Applying to NLP PhD Program](https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2019/10/24/student-perspectives-on-applying-to-nlp-phd-programs/)
* [Kalpesh Krishna's Grad School Resources](https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2018/05/29/grad-resources.html)

Lastly, many CS departments have started offering feedback on statements. I encourage people (especially those of underrepresented background) to take advantage of the opportunity.
