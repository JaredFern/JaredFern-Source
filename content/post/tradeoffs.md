For my thoughts and advice on getting started in Computer Science, see [https://jaredfern.com/posts/opportunities].

## Why do you want to go back to school?

* Large opportunity cost
* Certain positions require advanced study (research, professional degrees)
* ML Note: Many applied science roles do not necessarily require advanced study

* Academic setting:
  * Build stronger knowledge of fundamentals and depth of field
  * Ability to deep dive projects as opposed to being constrained by results or timeline
    * allows more time for exploring root cause and interpretability
  * Less well-defined problems that may require creative solutions

* Industry setting:
  * prioritization of projects and understanding utility
  * real world applications and constraints
  * working with actual systems and  teams of people
  * problems of design, implementation scalability
