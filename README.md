# Hugo Source for Portfolio Site
Mostly markdown, some html partials and css changes, otherwise pretty much default [Hugo Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme. View the site at https://jaredfern.com. 

**TODOs:**
 * Add accent colors on hyperlinks
 * Figure out where to add CV
 * Parameterize custom CSS modifications
